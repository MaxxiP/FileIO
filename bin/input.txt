Assignment

These are the required exercises for this week. Work in groups of two, each of you hands in the same report. Remember to put your names on the report. You can continue to use BlueJ, or move to Eclipse, if you wish. We will be practicing much programming in the small this semester.

How do you go about reading in characters from a file? Write and test a method that returns the next character in a file. Note that you have to do something with the carriage returns - such as ignoring them - and that you have to decide what to do when there are no characters to be returned.
How do you write a String to a file? How do you write an Integer to a file? An int? How do you create a file, anyway?
Now the fun begins! Write a Java application to read in a file character by character, counting the frequencies with which each character occurs. When there are no more characters, create a file frequency.txt and output the frequencies for each character.
Output a histogram of the character frequencies. One simple kind of histogram has horizontal lines proportional to the magnitude of the number it represents. For example:

A : **********
B : *****
C : ******
What is the complexity of your algorithm?
